This program simulates a simple plurality election where voters cast a single vote for one of the candidates. The program takes the candidate names from the command line and then prompts the user to input votes. 
After all votes are cast, the program prints the winner (or winners, in the case of a tie). The voting is straightforward, as each candidate's votes are tallied, 
and the one with the most votes wins. This program is a demonstration of a basic first-past-the-post voting system.
